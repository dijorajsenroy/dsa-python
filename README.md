# Placement and Interview Questions

My codes, and materials for Data Structures and Algorithms, and important interview problems from competitive coding platforms. Main resource is Geeks for geeks for theory and questions are from GFG, Hackerrank and Leetcode, do contribute and add important questions and solutions accordingly, best of luck for interviews!

## In the Repository:

1. Math Problems and Bit Manipulation
2. Classic Recursion Problems
3. Array and Matrix Problems
4. String Manipulation Problems
5. Searching and Sorting Problems
6. Hashing Technique Problems

# Contribution Guideline:

The files are all in .py files, all codes are python implementations in form of functions. To describe what the function does please add a docstring above it,
briefly describing the implementation of the algorithm. If the algorithm is taken from a particular source, like Hackerrank or Leetcode, mention that as well.

(A) Math and Bits

For popular named algorithms add the code in Useful-Named-Algorithms.py.
For Bit Maniplation problems add the code in Bit_Manipulation.py.
For general math problems add the code in Math_Problems.py.

(B) Recursion

For recursion problems there are three files for easy, intermediate and classic problems. Add the code accordingly.

(C) Arrays and Matrices

For introductory problems on 1D array add the code to Array_Basic_Problems.py.
For intermediate problems on 1D array add the code to Array_Intermediate_Problems.py.
For Matrix algorithms add the code to Matrix_Problems.py.
For popular CP problems add the code to Important_Problems_1.py.

(D) Strings

(E) Searching and Sorting

(F) Hashing Techniques
