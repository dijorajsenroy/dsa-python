# Placement and Interview Questions

My codes, and materials for Data Structures and Algorithms, and important interview problems from competitive coding platforms. Main resource is Geeks for geeks questions, contribute and add important questions and solutions accordingly, best of luck for interviews!

# In the Repository:

1. Math Problems and Bit Manipulation
2. Classic Recursion Problems
3. Array and Matrix Problems
4. String Manipulation Problems

# Instructions for contribution:

The files are all in .py files, all codes are python implementations in form of fucntions. To describe what the function does please add a docstring above it,
briefly describing the implementation of the algorithm. 

(A)
For common math, bit manipulation problems add code with docstring in the respective file in Math and Bits/..
For populare named algorithms add the code in Useful-Named-Algorithms.py

(B)
For recursion problems there are three files for easy, intermediate and classic problems. Add the code accordingly

(C)
For Arrays and Matrices, There are files for basic array manipulation, intermediate problems, etc.
