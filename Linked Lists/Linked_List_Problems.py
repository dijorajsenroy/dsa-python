1. Reversal of Linked Lists:

To reverse a Linked List we create three pointers, prevN, currN, nextN. prevN and nextN is intiially null, and currN is set to head node.
A loop is used till curr reaches null (at which point) prevN is the previous node and last node. With every iteration of the loop the steps:
(i) The next node is stored temporarily in nextN so that it may used later, as curr node will be de-linked from it.
(ii) Set the current node's link to the previous node. Intially the current node (head) will be set to null (prev). This reverses the 
direction of the link as curr now points the other way. 
(iii) Set prev to the current node as the next node that will be reversed in next iteration should point to this.
(iv) Set current node to the next node. By doing this, we have reversed the link of the current node to make it point the node before it,
set up the prev node in a way that its reference is now the curr node, and curr and next both point to the node that should be reversed,
this is repeated till prev becomes the last node.
(v) When prev is the last node set it as the new head of the list.

3. Detect and remove loops in a Linked List:

This problem is going to be solved using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. We can also use a hash set to keep
track of seen datapoints and return True, when a loop is found (element is seen twice) else it is added to set.
In Floyd's cycle detection - we traverse a linked list using two pointers. We move one pointer one step, the
other by two steps. If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet 
then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop. Floyd's Algorithm is also known as Tortoise and Hare algorithm. Refer to
the Floyds_Cycle.gif file in the folder for the animation. 

The steps in Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm:
t - tortoise (slow moving), h - hare (fast moving)
(i) Run a loop and check whether t, h or h.next is null. If it is null then there is no loop, as a linked list
with a loop will never point to null, it always points to one of its nodes. 
(ii) When there is no cycle, h is the first one to reach null as it moves two steps. However when there is a cycle
there is a point where t and h meet at the same node, when that happens we know a cycle exists and return True.

Removal of loops - This is based on Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm, which we use to determine the first
meeting point of the two pointers. The algorithm states that the second meeting point of the pointers will
be the first node of the cycle if the following steps are followed:
(i) Use Floyd's Algo to find the first meeting point of the slow and fast pointers. 
(ii) Set the slow pointer to the head node, and move them both at a pace of one node each till they coincide.
(iii) The point at the two pointers collide is the first node of the cycle, if we maintain a prev pointer to 
the fast pointer or compare the next of the two pointers till collision, we see that the fast pointer is the
last node of the linked list and points to the first node of the cycle. Thus we need to de-link the past pointer.
